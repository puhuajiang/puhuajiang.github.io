## About Me

I am currently a Researcher at Tencent Hunyuan, working on 3D computer vision and graphics. Prior to this, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University, where I was supervised by <a href="https://rqhuang88.github.io/" class="pubbutton">Prof. Ruqi Huang</a>. I received my M.S. degree in Computer Vision from University of Michigan. During COVID-19, I had internships as a research assistant at Tsinghua University supervised by <a href="http://www.luvision.net/" class="pubbutton">Prof. Lu Fang</a>. I received my B.S. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2019.
